# Run

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **version 16+ at least**:

Then go

```
npm install
```

and then

```
npm run start
```

You'll need to ask someone for `config.json` though :)

When it starts, check the console output to verify that `ffmpeg` is installed:

```
FFmpeg
- version: 4.4-essentials_build-www.gyan.dev      
- libopus: yes
```

# Dev Setup

Step 1. Use VS Code

Step 2. Install Prettier and eslint plugins from the Extensions tab.

Step 3. `Ctrl + shift + p` while in a `.ts` file and search for `Format Document`. Selecting it should prompt you to select the code formatter - choose Prettier.
