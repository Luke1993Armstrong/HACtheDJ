# Run

First install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (if you don't have it):

```
choco install ffmpeg
```

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **version 16+ at least**:

Then go

```
npm install
```

and then

```
npm run start
```

You'll need to ask someone for `config.json` though :)

When it starts, check the console output to verify that `ffmpeg` is installed:

```
FFmpeg
- version: 4.4-essentials_build-www.gyan.dev      
- libopus: yes
```
